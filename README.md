# WorldMaker
A C++ SFML automaton strategy game. Based on things I have done and learned in my game development of Conquest.

Using VS17

No CMake files yet
I plan to add Windows Executables

The only dependency is SFML 2.5 right now. I plan on adding a UI library that works with SFML.

# About the Game
Awhile ago I developed Conquest using SFML. I made some sloppy code and mistakes and ran into the classic game development
problem from most solo developers which was I had a big idea but a lot of work and design decisions to be made. So I put the project
on hold per say.

I started WorldMaker which needs a new name. And wanted to make a simple not too ambition game.

In game you will control an empire. Each citizen you cannot directly control and each citizen will be its own object. Hopefully the goal
is your empire will control to grow and develop over time.
